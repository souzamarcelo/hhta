# HHTA
**Hybrid Heuristics for the Test-Assignment problem**

This repository contains two heuristic algorithms (HHTA1 and HHTA2) that solve the test-assignment problem via UBQP (Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming). They were automatically generated using the [AutoBQP](https://github.com/souzamarcelo/AutoBQP) solver. The automated algorithm design process and HHTA algorithms are detailed in the following article (see ER1 and ER2 algorithms).
